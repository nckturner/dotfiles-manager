dotfiles
========

This is my dotfiles management suite.  It is simple and opinionated when it can be, and customizable when it must be.  

Enjoy.

*This repository is currently in pre-alpha and barely usable.  Feel free to contribute, or wait a couple weeks for it to mature slightly.*

Getting Started
---------------

Clone dotfiles into ~/.dotfiles:
```
git clone https://github.com/rask0l/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && ~/.dotfiles/bin/bootstrap
```
